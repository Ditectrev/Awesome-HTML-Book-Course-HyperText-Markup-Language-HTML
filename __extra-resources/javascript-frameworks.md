# JavaScript Frameworks Supporting Modular Architecture

Modular architecture is a design principle that allows developers to break down applications into smaller, reusable, and independent modules. Below is a list of JavaScript frameworks that support modular architecture:

## React

- **Type**: Library (often used as a framework)
- **Features**: Component-based architecture, reusable modules, and state management with tools like Redux or Context API.
- **Website**: [https://reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org)
- **Notes**: Mentioned in the video recording.

## Angular

- **Type**: Full-fledged framework
- **Features**: Built-in dependency injection, modular NgModules, and a powerful CLI for scaffolding.
- **Website**: [https://angular.io](https://angular.io)
- **Notes**: Mentioned in the video recording.

## Vue.js

- **Type**: Progressive framework
- **Features**: Component-based structure, Vuex for state management, and support for single-file components.
- **Website**: [https://vuejs.org](https://vuejs.org)
- **Notes**: Mentioned in the video recording.

## Svelte

- **Type**: Framework
- **Features**: Component-based architecture, no virtual DOM, and modularity through Svelte components.
- **Website**: [https://svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev)
- **Notes**: Not mentioned in the video recording.

## Ember.js

- **Type**: Framework
- **Features**: Convention over configuration, modular structure with Ember CLI, and built-in state management.
- **Website**: [https://emberjs.com](https://emberjs.com)
- **Notes**: Not mentioned in the video recording.

## Next.js

- **Type**: Framework (built on React)
- **Features**: Modular file-based routing, server-side rendering, and API routes for modular backend logic.
- **Website**: [https://nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org)
- **Notes**: Not mentioned in the video recording.

## Nuxt.js

- **Type**: Framework (built on Vue.js)
- **Features**: Modular file-based routing, server-side rendering, and support for Vuex for state management.
- **Website**: [https://nuxt.com](https://nuxt.com)
- **Notes**: Not mentioned in the video recording.

## Meteor

- **Type**: Full-stack framework
- **Features**: Modular packages, real-time data updates, and support for both frontend and backend development.
- **Website**: [https://www.meteor.com](https://www.meteor.com)
- **Notes**: Not mentioned in the video recording.

## Lit

- **Type**: Library (for building web components)
- **Features**: Modular web components, lightweight, and reusable custom elements.
- **Website**: [https://lit.dev](https://lit.dev)
- **Notes**: Not mentioned in the video recording.

These frameworks and libraries provide robust support for modular development, enabling developers to build scalable and maintainable applications.
