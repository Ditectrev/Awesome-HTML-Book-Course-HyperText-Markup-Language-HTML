# Cross-Browser Compatibility

When working on web development projects, ensuring cross-browser compatibility is crucial. This involves making sure that your website or application works seamlessly across different browsers and their versions.

## Tools for Cross-Browser Compatibility

### 1. [Modernizr](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr)

Modernizr is a powerful JavaScript library that helps detect HTML5 and CSS3 features in the user's browser. By using Modernizr, you can conditionally load polyfills or apply specific styles based on the features supported by the browser.

#### Key Features:

- Detects support for over 40 HTML5 and CSS3 features.
- Provides a simple API for feature detection.
- Allows developers to write fallback code for unsupported features.

#### Example Usage:

```html
<script src="modernizr.js"></script>
<script>
  if (Modernizr.canvas) {
    console.log('Canvas is supported!');
  } else {
    console.log('Canvas is not supported. Consider using a polyfill.');
  }
</script>
```

### 2. [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/)

While Modernizr is a great tool for runtime feature detection, the best tool for checking browser support during development is [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/). This website provides up-to-date information on the compatibility of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies across different browsers.

#### Why Can I Use is the Best Tool:

- Comprehensive database of browser support for web technologies.
- Easy-to-use search functionality.
- Regularly updated with the latest browser versions and features.
- Includes usage statistics to help prioritize features based on audience.

#### Example Workflow:

1. Search for a feature (e.g., `flexbox`) on [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/).
2. Review the compatibility table to see which browsers support the feature.
3. Use the information to decide whether to implement the feature or provide fallbacks.

By combining tools like Modernizr and Can I Use, you can ensure a smooth user experience across a wide range of browsers and devices.
