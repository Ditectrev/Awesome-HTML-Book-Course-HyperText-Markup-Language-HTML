# Media Capture and Streams API - Additional Resources

Here are some useful documentation links we visited during the recording. Feel free to explore and experiment with the options:

1. [MDN: HTML Attribute Reference - `accept`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/accept)
2. [MDN: HTML Attribute Reference - `capture`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/capture)

Additionally, we referred to a popular Stack Overflow discussion where it was clarified that the `capture` attribute does not require the value `"camera"`:

- [Stack Overflow: HTML5 Input Type File Accept Image Capture Camera Display as Image](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23916566/html5-input-type-file-accept-image-capture-camera-display-as-image-rat)
