# File API and Related Topics

During the recording, I mentioned the **File API** class and referred to the MDN documentation for the `<input type="file">` element. You can read more about it here: [MDN Docs - `<input type="file>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/file).

Additionally, I demonstrated the `<pre>` HTML tag, which is useful for displaying preformatted text. You can find more details on this tag at [W3Schools - `<pre>` Tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_pre.asp).

We also explored the `FileReader` API, specifically the `readAsDataURL` method, which allows you to convert an image to Base64 format. For more information, check out: [MDN Docs - FileReader.readAsDataURL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsDataURL).

Finally, we reviewed the Base64-encoded image using the [Base64 Guru](https://base64.guru/) website.
