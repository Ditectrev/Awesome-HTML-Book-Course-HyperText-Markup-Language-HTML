# Introduction to HTML

## What is HTML?
HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. As the backbone of all web pages, HTML allows us to structure content with elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images. Unlike programming languages that provide logic and functionality, HTML is a markup language that defines the structure and layout of web content.

### Brief History of HTML and Its Evolution
![A timeline graphic showing key milestones in the history of HTML, from HTML 1.0 to HTML5.](images/section1_1.png)
The journey of HTML began in the early 1990s, devised by Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at the CERN research facility in Switzerland. Initially created to facilitate information sharing between scientists across different universities and institutes, HTML has evolved significantly over the years. Key milestones include:

- HTML 2.0 (1995): The first standard version, which set the core features of HTML.
- HTML 4.01 (1999): Introduced more robust features for modern web design.
- XHTML (2000): A hybrid between HTML and XML, offering more strict syntax rules.
- HTML5 (2014): The latest major version, bringing enhanced support for multimedia, graphics, and mobile-friendly features.

These developments were guided by organizations such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), playing pivotal roles in standardizing HTML.

### Understanding the Role of HTML in Web Development

HTML is a key component of the web development ecosystem, used in conjunction with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. While HTML lays out the structure of the page, CSS is used for styling, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic content. This combination is essential in creating a diverse range of web applications, from simple static websites to complex interactive platforms.

### Overview of Web Browsers and How They Interpret HTML
![Browser Rendering: showing how a sample HTML code is rendered in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).](images/section1_3.png)
Web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge are the tools through which users interact with HTML documents. Each browser interprets HTML code to display web pages. Understanding how different browsers parse and render HTML is crucial for developers to ensure consistency and compatibility across the web. This section can delve into the concept of browser rendering engines, cross-browser compatibility issues, and the importance of following web standards to minimize inconsistencies.

#### Example: Basic HTML Structure
Below is an example of a basic HTML document structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
This code demonstrates a simple HTML page structure with the essential elements: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.

## Setting Up the Environment

### Installing and Configuring a Text Editor
Before diving into HTML coding, it's essential to choose and set up a text editor - a basic tool where you will write and edit your HTML code. There are several popular editors suited for web development, each with its unique features and advantages:

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: A versatile and widely-used editor by Microsoft, known for its extensive extension library, integrated terminal, and Git control.
- **Sublime Text**: Known for its speed and efficiency, Sublime Text offers a distraction-free coding environment with a vast array of keyboard shortcuts.
- **Atom**: Developed by GitHub, Atom is a highly customizable editor with a friendly interface, ideal for beginners and experienced developers alike.

#### Installing Your Chosen Editor
- Provide step-by-step instructions for downloading and installing the chosen text editor.
- Highlight the importance of familiarizing oneself with the basic features and user interface of the editor.

### Understanding the File Structure for Web Projects
![Web Project File Structure Diagram: A flowchart or tree diagram showing a typical web project's file structure, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and a folder for images.](images/section2_2.png)
Organizing files and folders properly is crucial in web development. A basic project might include separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, along with a directory for images and other media.

Proper organization of web project files is crucial for maintainability and scalability. A typical HTML project might include:

- **HTML Files**: The core files with a .html extension where the HTML code is written.
- **CSS Files**: Separate files (usually with a .css extension) for styling.
- **JavaScript Files**: Files containing JavaScript code, usually with a .js extension.
- **Images and Multimedia**: A folder dedicated to storing images, videos, and other media assets.
- **Miscellaneous Files**: Other files like fonts, icons, or third-party libraries.

#### Setting Up a Basic File Structure
- Guide on creating a basic directory and file structure for a simple HTML project.
- Emphasize the importance of consistent naming conventions and organization.

#### Example: Setting Up a Basic HTML File Structure
Imagine you're creating a simple website. Here's how you might set up the files and folders:

1. **Create a Project Folder**: name it `MyFirstWebsite`.
2. **Add HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Files**: inside the folder, create three files:
   - `index.html` (for HTML content)
   - `styles.css` (for CSS styles)
   - `script.js` (for JavaScript code)

3. **Create Project Structure**: in your preferred text editor, like this one below:

```
MyFirstWebsite/
│
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── script.js
```

4. **Write Basic HTML Code**: in `index.html`, you can start with a simple structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph on my first webpage.</p>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

5. **Add Some Styles**: in `styles.css`, add some basic styling:

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

h1 {
    color: navy;
}
```

6. **Include a JavaScript File**: in `script.js`, write a simple script:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    console.log("Welcome to My First Website!");
});
```

### Basics of Document Object Model (DOM)
![Anatomy of an HTML Document: A labeled diagram showing the structure of an HTML document, with tags like <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, and <body>.](images/section2_3.png)
Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM) is fundamental in web development. It's a programming interface for HTML and XML documents that defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.

- **What is the DOM?**: An explanation of how the DOM represents a web page as a tree-like structure.
- **Interacting with the DOM**: An overview of how browsers create the DOM and how it can be manipulated with JavaScript to dynamically change HTML and CSS.

#### Exploring the DOM in a Browser:
- Instructions on how to inspect the DOM using browser developer tools.
- Simple exercises to demonstrate the manipulation of the DOM elements.

#### Example: Exploring the DOM
Here's a simple exercise to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript:

1. **Add a Button in HTML**: in `index.html`, add a button element:

```html
<button id="changeColorButton">Change Color</button>
```

2. **JavaScript to Change Text Color**: in `script.js`, add a script to change the color of the paragraph when the button is clicked:

```javascript
document.getElementById('changeColorButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    document.querySelector('p').style.color = 'red';
});
```

This code selects the button with the ID `changeColorButton` and adds an event listener to it. When clicked, it changes the color of the first paragraph to red.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document
The foundation of any web page is its HTML structure. Understanding this structure is crucial for effective web development.

### Anatomy of an HTML Document
An HTML document is structured with various elements, each serving a specific purpose. The basic components include the `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

#### Example: Basic Anatomy of an HTML Document

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Title</title>
    <!-- Other head elements like links to CSS files, metadata go here -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Webpage content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Declaration, Head, and Body Sections
Understanding each section of an HTML document is important for structuring web content correctly.

#### The `<!DOCTYPE>` Declaration
The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about the HTML version being used. For HTML5, it is simply declared as `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

#### The `<head>` Section
The `<head>` section contains meta-information about the document, such as its title, character set, viewport settings, links to CSS files, and other metadata.

#### The `<body>` Section
The `<body>` section encloses the actual content of the webpage, such as text, images, links, tables, lists, and other elements.

### Understanding DOCTYPE
The DOCTYPE declaration should be the very first thing in an HTML document, before the `<html>` tag. The DOCTYPE declaration is not case sensitive.

#### Example: HTML5 DOCTYPE

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- This is the standard declaration for HTML5 documents -->
```

#### Example: Creating a Simple HTML Page

1. **Create a File**: name it `index.html`.
2. **Write Basic HTML Code**: add the following basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Simple Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
